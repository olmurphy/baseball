Notes about ER:
	(1) all "ID's" under the original database have been changed to "<table_name>_ID" to satisfy the unique names
	(2) tables awardsplayers and awardsmanagers were combined into "awards"
	(3) tables awardsshareplayers and awardssharemanagers were combined into "awardsshare"
	(4) the Batting and batting post have been combined to allow for "stint" and "round". However, the option of doing each one as a table was followed due to trouble with pythong program to insert data into the table
	(5) Same as (4) in regards to the Pitching and Pichting post
	(6) the attributes such as HR, H, etc. are shared among batting and pitching. Each shared attribute that was not the same was given a new name as "<table_name>_HR", "<table_name>_H", etc. in the create table statements, NOT reflected in the ER diagram.
